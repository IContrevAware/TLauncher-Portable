PLEASE READ NOTES IN THE SELECTED .MD FILE
TLP, Tlauncher-Portable. If you want to build it yourself completely then go to Tlauncher-Portable.md and follow instructions. If you want to do less work then use the TLPSP.md.
If you see a new version of TL please add a pull request to tell me to update it in the TLP starter pack. The TLPSP way is the safest as I have checked all the files in it.
