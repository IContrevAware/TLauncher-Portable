1. Codes, DL=Drive letter aka D:\ drive │ MFN= Main folder (name) │ M-F= Main-Folder
2. Download starter pack from the releases
3. Ensure you have windows and you can use the exes in the starter pack.
4. If you cannot use those files in the starter pack using windows please use Tlauncher-Portable.md
5. Open the java installation file and download to the folder (DL\MFN\jdk64)
6. Open Tlauncher installation file (Accept UAC if needed) and download (we will make it portable)
7. Uncheck boxes
8. Win+R
9. Type %appdata%
10. Go to the .minecraft (or .tlauncher idk) folder and copy Tlauncher.exe
11. Paste it into the M-F
12. Go to the appdata folder and delete .tlauncher and .minecraft
13. Okay, did you see the Start.bat. When you want to open TLP then use the Start.bat
Advanced. If you are very smart in computers you can use a different java, Perhaps change Start.bat
Additional. If you arent smart in computers probably ask AI to fit it.

NOTES
===== 
If you are using a different java then probably make AI to remake it for your java if you arent smart in computers.
All links used in my opinion safe but if anything bad happens to it its YOUR responsibility.
Only works for windows. 
The portable Java might not work if you are running a newer version of MC, example : java 8 on 1.21 (not compatible).
Tlauncher is recognised as SPYWARE so do NOT use a Mojang account, use prism launcher if you have a real account 
Tlauncher is also cracked so it is illegal (piracy) Use at your own Risk!

Additonal Links
==============
I reccomend : go to https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases and scroll until you see Windows and 2 versions MSI and ZIP click zip
Ask AI to remake this using the adoptium jdk
