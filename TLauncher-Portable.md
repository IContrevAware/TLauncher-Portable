TLauncher-Portable ================== I don\'t like TL but lots of
people do so, portable time

1. create a folder I will name it \"TLP\" for this tutorial.
2. Download portable java we will use https://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/jdkportable64 if it doesn\'t work then use a different one. 
3. Go to TLauncher\'s official website : tlauncher.org 
4. Download it
5. Open the Java installation file and download it to the TLP folder (or whatever you named it)
6. Open the Tlauncher installation file
7. If it says "Do you want this app to make changes to your device" or something similar then accept
8. Now install it normally (Don't worry, we will make this portable soon)
9. Uncheck all the boxes.
10. Press Win+R (the Win button is the button with 4 squares on it on the keyboard)
11. Type exactly "%appdata%
12. 12. Go to the .minecraft folder
13. Copy the Tlauncher.exe
14. Paste it into the TLP folder (or the folder name)
15. Go back to the Appdata folder and delete .minecraft and .tlauncher
16. Create a text document
17. Open it in a note editing tool (any)
18. Go to https://pastebin.com/KUR7GbxJ and copy the text and paste it
19. Then click save as, then name it whatever but make sure it is on All Files and named (Your_Name).bat but I will name it Start.bat and click ok
20. Delete text document but keep the .bat file
21. DONE! Always start it from Start.bat

NOTES ===== If you are using a different java then probably make ai to
remake it for your java All links used in my opinion safe but if
anything bad happens to it its YOUR responsibility. Only works for
windows. The portable Java might not work if you are running a newer
version of MC, example : java 8 on 1.21 (not compatible) Tlauncher is
recognised as SPYWARE so do NOT use a Mojang account, use prism launcher
if you have a real account Tlauncher is also cracked so it is illegal
(piracy) Use at your own Risk!
